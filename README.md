# Percolation
A system is modeled by an n x n grid of *closed* nodes.
<br><br>Nodes can be: 
* Closed
* Open (empty)
* Open (full)

A node is said to be *full* if it shares a connection with the topmost row. The system percolates once a *full* node reaches the bottom row. 
<br>Using Monte Carlo simulations, we can estimate the neccessary conditions for a percolative system.
